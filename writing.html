            <p>When you take your first step in our diner, you may be excited or frightened by those huge dinosaurs
                scattered throughout the place. No need to worry, they aren’t animate, and if they happen to be, life
                finds a way. Typically, there isn’t a long line because only reservations are allowed. Except, if you
                arrive more than 15 minutes late, you have failed your very first task and as a punishment, you’ll have
                to make a new reservation. Once you are introduced to your seat(s), you’ll only have to wait a minute
                until your order arrives fresh and delicious. You may fear showing bad table manners. No need to worry,
                there’s no wrong way to eat! If you want to eat like a real dinosaur, go ahead, and we’ll happily cheer
                you on. If you rather not, that’s completely fine. We still appreciate you for choosing us as your
                hosts.</p>

            <p>Lastly, the Oasis school system allows interactive experiences students cannot do in the real world.
                Attending school on the virtual planet Ludus will give students an opportunity to go on trips to
                unreachable places like the moon, the great pyramid, the human body, etc.. In addition, connecting with
                each other would be easier for students living around the world since they are online.</p>

            <p>You draw out your glowing Magic Sword, and with hesitation challenge the Evil Wizard to a duel. To your
                surprise, you defeat the evil wizard, and successfully reach the portal with your cat you thought was
                missing forever. Now, there is no need to worry, you're once again living in your ordinary world!</p>
